# FreematicsCell7600
I wrote this fork of FreematicsCell back in Feburary of 2021 to add support for the SIMCOM7600 on the [Freematic Espirit](https://freematics.com/products/freematics-esprit/), but forgot to publish it until now. I leave this here more so for the GPS functionality I add. In the last 10 months, [Stanley Huangyc](https://github.com/stanleyhuangyc) has implemented SIM7600 and has moved from FreematicsCell into a new library called [FreematicsNetwork](https://github.com/stanleyhuangyc/Freematics/blob/master/libraries/FreematicsPlus/FreematicsNetwork.cpp). No one should use the code I'm uploading here in favor for FreematicsNetowrk, but I provide it as a backup. Some examples of how I've used this code are provided.
